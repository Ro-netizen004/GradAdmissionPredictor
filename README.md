# Graduate Admission Predictor
Link to site: https://gradadmissionpredictor.onrender.com/

A web application that predicts the chance of admission to graduate programs using a Linear Regression model built with Scikit-Learn. The model uses various academic and application parameters to provide a probability score that helps prospective students assess their chances of admission.

## Features

- Predict admission chances based on GRE score, TOEFL score, University Rating, SOP, LOR strength, CGPA, and Research experience.
- Built with Python, Scikit-Learn, and Flask (or your chosen web framework).
- Simple, intuitive web interface for inputting applicant details and displaying predictions.
- Demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow: data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Mohan S Acharyaâ€™s Graduate Admissions dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions), which contains parameters important to graduate admissions from an Indian perspective.
